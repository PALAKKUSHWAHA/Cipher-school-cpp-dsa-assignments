C++ Variables
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). For example,

int age = 14;
Here, age is a variable of the int data type, and we have assigned an integer value 14 to it.

The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.

int age = 14;   // age is 14
age = 17;       // age is 17

C++ Constants
In C++, we can create variables whose value cannot be changed. For that, we use the const keyword. Here's an example:

const int LIGHT_SPEED = 299792458;
LIGHT_SPEED = 2500 //Error! LIGHT_SPEED is a constant.
Here, we have used the keyword const to declare a constant named LIGHT_SPEED. If we try to change the value of LIGHT_SPEED, we will get an error.

A constant can also be created using the #define preprocessor directive. 


C++ Literals

Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For example: 1, 2.5, 'c' etc.

Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.
